\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Should be enough to create a very simple target!
    \item Many things were not covered in this talk:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Using different types and legalization
        \item Scheduling
        \item Intrinsics
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \item Introduced resources to go further
