\begin{frame}{When something goes wrong}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find which pass introduces the issue:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $llc\ -print-after-all$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Find the LLVM source file and category for this pass:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\#define\ DEBUG\_TYPE\ "codegen-dce"$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Dump the log:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $llc\ foo.ll -debug-only\ codegen-dce\ 2>\&1 > foo.log$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Compare (diff) the '-print-after-all' or '-debug-only' good and bad outputs to see where it goes wrong
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Debugging LLVM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item MIs, BBs, functions, almost anything → call X.dump()
    \item DAGs, CFGs → call X.viewGraph() (pops up xdot)
    \item Or from the terminal: llc foo.ll -view-isel-dags
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try -view-dag1-combine-dags, -view-legalize-dags, -view-sched-dags, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item To view graphs, make sure you build LLVM in debug mode!
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Turn on LLVM\_ENABLE\_ASSERTIONS (i.e. NDEBUG should not be defined)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{"Cannot select"}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When LLVM doesn't know how to map ('lower') a DAG node to an actual instruction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Missing pattern in LEGInstrInfo.td?
        \item Without a pattern, lowering needs to be done in LEGISelDAGToDag::Select()
    \end{itemize}
    \item Check the graph!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The dog ate my homework}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Why did my code disappear?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Missing chain/glue in the DAG
        \item Dead code elimination may have removed it
    \end{itemize}
    \item DCE does not touch instructions whose value is used by other instructions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Root your use/def chains using a MI that has side-effects
    \end{itemize}
    \item DCE does not touch instructions with side-effects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item mayLoad, mayStore, isTerminator, hasSideEffects
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Useful in-tree resources}

\begin{itemize}
    \item include/llvm/Target/Target*.h
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shows all target-specific hooks that can be overridden, with useful comments
    \end{itemize}
    \item include/llvm/Target/Target*.td
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shows all TableGen fields you can use in your target files
    \end{itemize}
    \item include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lists all SelectionDAG nodes and descriptions of what they mean
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{You're not alone!}

\begin{itemize}
    \item "Writing an LLVM Backend" at \url{llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.html}
    \item Other backends 
    \item TableGen backend documentation
    \item LLVM-Dev mailing lists
    \item Anton Korobeynikov's 2009 and 2012 "Building a backend in 24 hours" tutorials
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
